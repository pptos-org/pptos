## Eminent OS

### Eminent OS
**Eminent OS** is the upcoming new OS by **Presentasia Technologies**, the company who creates the well-known Presentasia OS. It is not released yet. Eminent OS is expected to be released in 2014. It was recognized for its simple and fluid user interface. It will be the most realistic PPTOS ever created by Presentasia Technologies. However, Eminent OS was cancelled on June 21, 2014 by Presentasia, and the company said that all the features of Eminent (mentioned below) will be moved to Presentasia OS 9, the next Presentasia OS series.

### Features
Eminent OS was the first PPTOS to have Dynamic Desktops (everything from the applications menu to the search bar is on one slide, everchanging). 

The clock in the OS wasn't a VBA label. Instead, it was object-manipulated.

Apps in Eminent OS include: Internet Atlas, E-mail, Broadsheet, Music, and Media.

Eminent OS highlights the return of Internet Atlas (however WeBrowse wil remain in Presentasia OS, or WeBrowse will be available for Eminent as an app on Presentasia's WeShop, according to Presentasia Technologies).

### Broadsheet
Broadsheet is an office app included with Eminent OS. Not much information is known about it, however according to the teaser pictures, Broadsheet is the first Office app for PPTOSes to have the realistic filename system, and it knows if your document name is too long and asks you to shorten it.
