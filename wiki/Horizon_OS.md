### Project J Inc.
Project J Inc. (aka. SargentDoom) is a small indie PowerPoint developer who like making concepts and not following through with them! He is the developer of the HorizonOS / J Inc. OS family as well as PowerPoint Windows XP.


### History
Development of the J Inc. OS family began in 2017 with J Inc. OS 1.0 being the first version. It however was not functional and was just an OS concept. It still laid the groundwork for years to come. 

J Inc. OS 2.0 came just 7 short months later which replaced the green forest design with a red design. It however was still only a concept.

J Inc. OS 3.0 came 2 years later in 2019 which introduced an cool blue water theme which was used for inspiration for the current UI of HorizonOS EXP. It was now semi functional, but no VBA code was used.

J Inc. OS 4.0 came 1 month later which replaced the water theme with a purple galaxy theme. It also improved functionality and started to feature basic ActiveX and VBA code. He finally discovered the developer tab!

J Inc. OS 2019 edition which had basically a Windows 8.1 UI rip-off but it was the first proper PPTOS by Project: J Inc. (Then known as Blobyj09 but was not present in the PPTOS community)

AreoOS followed 2019 edition in 2020 but J Inc. got lazy and it was only a wanna be windows 7 rip-off concept! BUT, AreoOS was the groundwork for J Inc. OS Areo!
J Inc. OS Areo is basically a SP1 update to AeroOS but J Inc. OS Areo would be rebranded and reset in early 2021! It was about 6 months before J Inc. made an appearance in Project: PowerPoint’s discord server!

J Inc. OS EXP was based on Project: PowerPoint’s ROBLOXOS 8. It was about 6 months into development but had a terrible WinXP Hybrid WinVista UI. That would be forgotten no long after he joined Projects server. Many builds and resets followed J Inc.’s appearance in the server as seeing the design of others’ UI taught him some valuable skills. He announced ActiveX Edition and Professional Edition (which was based on loop technology)

About 7 months into development and the announcement that J Inc. OS EXP ActiveX and Professional Edition were going to be discontinued and a new, better PPTOS was to come. J Inc. announced that J inc. OS EXP was going to be rebranded to HorizonOS EXP and the project would be completely reset with NO slide transfers. 3 more half-resets and the project is where it is today!
