**Midtown ATIV Open-Source**

Midtown ATIV was then released again as "Open-Source" alongside with Midtown PREMIER Open-Source in March 26, 2014. It allows developers to add new apps/re create apps, fix bugs and more. However, they are a given a set of new guidelines (rules) on this version of Midtown. Also, they are not allowed to edit the preinstalled store but they can make their own store. 

#### Challenge for True Midtown Fans

Starting from nearly 14 February 2014, preview of UNITY was available for the whole week. This wasn't mentioned on any posts, topics on PPTOSN, neither on Midtown sites. The update was available via updater on PREMIER or ATIV. Later, preview became no longer available, as a Midtown post on UNITY topic on PPTOSN about that update.

That post was a picture, with screenshots of both PREMIER's and ATIV's updaters showing that UNITY is available for download, and the text says: 

<code style="background: #c1c1c1;border-radius: 5px;padding: 2px;">#atruemidtownfan will always check for updates on ATIV or PREMIER if UNITY is available.</code>
