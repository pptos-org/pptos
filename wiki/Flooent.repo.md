**flooent.repo** (formerly ZaphkielCorp and BubbleSoft) is a PowerPoint OS company based in Argentina. The company was founded in 2013-2014 by [Chessie Miu](https://pptos.fandom.com/wiki/User:WNRMaker100). Currently it is migrating to Chessie's other company called Perano, and is expected to shutdown by July 1, 2022.

Before founding the company, Chessie Miu ripped off another PowerPoint OS to edit in their own way, Which he called "Windows 6 1.6".

### Operating Systems

#### Bindows

Bindows was a series of (apparently rip-off) products mocking Microsoft Windows.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |

| Bindows 7                 | 2016                          | Never given any support       |
| Bindows 11                | 2016                          | Never given any support, could've been the future of Bindows|

It was developed from 2014-2016 until flooent.repo decided to cease the project entirely, due to being obviously a rip-off.

#### TreygenOS

After Bindows's descontinuation, flooent.repo decided to make a followup to Bindows and make it better. This obscure version was actually released, But we never got to see it completely.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |

| TreygenOS Prototype 1     | 2017                          | Never given any support       |
| TreygenOS Pre-Alpha       | 2018                          | Never given any support       |

This version is currently lost, And it can not be found anywhere.

#### Bobcat

After Bindows's descontinuation, flooent.repo tried to enter the "business" market with Bobcat, Which is supposed to be a more robust operating system built from scratch.

This operating system can be found in the Legacy Repository.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bobcat Build 4076         | 2016                          | Never given any support       |
| Bobcat Build 4081         | 2016                          | Never given any support       |
| Bobcat Build 4089         | 2018                          | Never given any support       |

#### SimpleDOS

SimpleDOS is just a version based off Bindows 8 but slimdown, there is also a basic version which is barebones, but made from scratch.

This version can be found in the official ZaphkielCorp site.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| SimpleDOS Bindows 8 Pre-Beta| 2015                        | Discontinued                  |
| SimpleDOS 1.02            | 2015                          | Discontinued                  |

#### MoonConsole

MoonConsole is flooent.repo's entrance into the gaming PowerPoint market. It was obviously based off Metro's appearance on Windows 8 and had added Bindows Media Center from Bindows 10.

#### BubbleSoftOS

BubbleSoftOS is the first "made out of scratch" operating system from flooent.repo, It was a concept of being a Android-based operating system, with technically including Android 7.

This version is forever lost.

#### BubbleSoftXP/ZaphkielXP/modernXP

modernXP, flooent.repo's latest product, Was developed after BubbleSoftOS was finished. The concept of this OS is to bring Windows XP with a new sleek look, And making their own base. The first versions of modernXP had a problem with the resolution, due to the objects being too big. Nevertheless, They managed to put a store and a internet browser.

Currently, modernXP is being developed and there is a new teaser on their channel.

#### Application Downloader

Application Downloader was a store for older versions of modernXP. In there, You could download apps for modernXP. The store disappeared for unknown reasons.
