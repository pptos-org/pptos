## Orbit OS

Project: PowerPoint is a PowerPoint OS developer whose most recent work started in December 2018.

This was after the PowerPoint OS Forums, so most news of release was spread across YouTube and Discord.

### ORBIT OS 
Orbit OS is the signature release of Project: PowerPoint, taking six months to complete. It is the start of a series of PowerPoint OS's to include as many features as possible. Orbit OS is open-source, granting other developers unlimited access to its utilities and source code.
The first Orbit OS release was codenamed "Goldsmith", with ties to its colour scheme. Its highlighted features included, but aren't limited to:
