### Starlite

Starlite is a OS made by Rohan, inspired by Zulo and zeqOS Chabazite. Starlite is the first OS that Rohan released into the public. This OS is semi-advanced with 
features like a command line, terminal mode, web browser, drawing etc. RTM versions are avalible, since Starlite has finished its beta testing/insider period for RTM V1.
Starlite will be open source forever. Plans for Starlite include new desktop enviroments, new flavours, and more apps. Starlite has a small insider team.

### Starlite RTM V1

V1 of Starlite RTM is released and it features a web browser, command line, CD reader and unique apps like Drawing. This release has some
bugs, design flaws etc which will be fixed in Starlite RTM V2. Starlite RTM V1 was made as a followup to Starlite Build 37, the last beta build of Starlite RTM V1.
