### Presentasia OS

**Presentasia OS** (formerly styled as **(Presentasia) OS**) is a family of PowerPoint OSes created
by Presentasia Technologies. It began in May 2012 with the first Presentasia OS, **Presentasia OS 1.0**. Now the company is working hard making Presentasia OS 9.

### Presentasia OS 1.0 & 1.0.1

### Presentasia OS 3.0 SnowBall
Presentasia OS 3.0 Snowball is the third version of Presentasia OS. It was released on August 29, 2012, a mere two weeks after Presentasia OS 2.0 TreeFrog was released. This was the first version of Presentasia OS to be in HD, unlike prior versions that had aspect ratios of 4:3. It retained UI features that prior versions included with minor improvements and the "Frost Light" theme. This version also introduced QuickAccess, which replaced Guest Mode from prior version of Presentasia OS. Other differences include the Presentasia Center being removed and a "Restart" button in the Shutdown Settings. This was also the last Classic Presentasia OS to feature Flatview Mode (which returns in Presentasia OS 8).

### Presentasia OS 4.0 Matrix
Presentasia OS 4.0 Matrix is the fourth version of Presentasia OS. This version is the final Classic Presentasia OS (retaining many of the same icons as prior versions). It is recognized for its theme, "Sleek Silver". This was the first version of Presentasia OS that used Macros.

### Presentasia OS 5.0 Kaleidoscope
Presentasia OS 5.0 Kaleidoscope is the fifth version of Presentasia OS. It was the first version of Presentasia OS to include shaded, glossy icons. This version also allowed for wallpaper changing but was limited to 4 preset backgrounds.

### Presentasia OS 6.0 Squared
Presentasia OS 6.0 Squared ist die sechste Presentasia OS-Version. Diese Version ist eigentlich die siebte Version von Presentasia gemacht: es gibt eine sehr obskure fertige Version Presentasia OS 6.0, die vollständig zu Gunsten der Version, die wir alle heute kennen zerkratzt wurde. Dies war die erste Version von Presentasia OS, um die vorliegende Logo (Winkel Stil) sind. Alte Versionen des Logos wurden noch in der OS vorgestellt; vor allem in der Files-App und Writasia App. Dies war die einzige Version, um eine andere Icon-Layout auf dem Desktop (unliked anderen Versionen, die Matrix-Benutzeroberfläche verwendet wird) zu verwenden. Internet-Atlas wurde mit WeBrowse ausgetauscht und enthalten einen Taschenrechner App und anpassbare Passwörter für die Admin-Konto.

### Presentasia OS 7 & 7.1
Presentasia OS 7 is the seventh version of Presentasia OS. It still contains elements that were featured in prior versions such as limited wallpapers, and the interface. This version ditched the style of 6.0 and went back to Matrix UI like all prior version of Presentasia OS (excluding 6.0). It was also the first Presentasia OS to remove start buttons or add-ins for in web apps.

Presentasia OS 7 is one of the only versions of Presentasia OS that doesn't have a version name. The 7.1 update addresses issues with changing the background.
### Presentasia OS 8.0 Boundless
Presentasia OS 8.0 Boundless is the latest and most popular version of Presentasia OS with over 2000 downloads. In this version, Calibri Light is the primary font, Mail and Writasia are replaced by WeMail and WeWrite, Calculator is replaced by WeCalculate, and the InfoTab is renamed the PresTab. This version also highlights the return of Flatview mode (which was previously used from Presentasia OS 2-3) as a desktop mode. This version of Presentasia OS also features Smart Desktops (memory of the origin of a program's opening; whether it be the MatrixView desktop, the FlatView Desktop, or any other menu). Presentasia OS 8 was also the first version of Presentasia OS to have the macro checkpoint upon startup to determine if macros are enabled (Press "Enter the OS" if you have macros enabled). Unlike prior text editors included with Presentasia OS, WeWrite requires the user to save their documents.

There was going to be an update to Presentasia OS 8.0 Boundless but was cancelled early on in development due to lack of third party support. This is confirmed by tweets Presentasia sent (@Presentasia_).

### Presentasia OS 9 Pavilion (latest)

**What's that?**

Presentasia OS 9 Pavilion is a PPTOS made by **Presentasia Technologies|Presentasia Technologies.** At first, OS 9 wasn't supposed to come this early, OS 9's development was supposed to come after Eminent's release. But, unfortunately, Eminent has been cancelled. According to Presentasia, that Eminent's features will come to OS 9, adding new features as well as replacing old ones. For example, WeWrite is replaced by Broadsheet Office, and offline integration might be in OS 9.

Pavilion's UI is called Matrix UI. The name might be also to the reference to '''(Presentasia) OS 4.0 codename Matrix''', which was released back in 2012. Matrix UI seems to look nothing like OS 4 Matrix where OS 4 was based on a grey theme (Sleek Silver), and Matrix UI is more vibrant with colors and a stunning flat design. It seems to be influenced by Apple iOS 7/8 (icons) and Windows 8 (notification style). The design of Matrix UI was taken directly from Presentasia's Mobile concept, posted a months ago.

In this version Presentasia Technologies introducing long-shadow and flat icons. Open Sans has also scrapped in OS 9, replaced by some other fonts. The layout from the previous Presentasia OSes still remains in OS 9. Author stated that Presentasia OS 9 is the most important version of the **Presentasia OS|Presentasia OS family** because there are 9 squares in its logo.

**Features (might not actual, this is only the set of the concept features)**

- Offline integration (previously in Eminent);
- New fonts, replacing Open Sans;
- Same old UI with the vibrant new look;
- Notification center;
- Music app (from Eminent);
- Broadsheet (replacing WeWrite);
- YouTube App and other web apps;
- Simple, flat design (Matrix UI);
- **PowerPoint OS Network|PPTOSN** app (This is the first **Presentasia OS** to include the Network app).

**Cancellation**

On October 1st, 2014. **Presentasia OS|Presentasia** cancelled all of his projects including OS9. And also he is resigning from PPTOSN. And Also he passing **PowerPoint OS Network|PPTOSN** to **Midtown OS|Midtown Technologies**. People are really upset that he has left PPTOSN and has stopped making OSes.
